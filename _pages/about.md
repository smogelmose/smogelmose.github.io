Thanks for stopping by!  

My current focus and projects  
======
• [Research](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10972842) and [Development](../_portfolio/portfolio-balance-VR.md) on the [Balance VR project](https://vbn.aau.dk/en/organisations/multisensory-experience-laboratory/publications/), investigating how spatialized sound influences sensory conflict and the relationship between balance and motion sickness in virtual reality.  

• [Developing](../_portfolio/portfolio-metahuman-eye.md) realistic [MetaHuman](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/metahuman/metahuman-creator) eye behavior in [UE 5.6](https://www.unrealengine.com/) using [Black Eye Camera](https://blackeyetechnologies.com/) and [ZenBlink plugins](https://support.zenblink.com/).  

• [Designing](../_portfolio/portfolio-alien-ai.md) an enemy AI system inspired by the Xenomorph AI from [Alien Isolation](https://www.sega.com/alien-isolation/alien-isolation) in [UE 5.6](https://www.unrealengine.com/) using Unreal Engine 5's [State Tree system](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/overview-of-state-tree-in-unreal-engine).  

Publications
======
• A Pilot Study into a Novel Application for Inducing and Studying Visually-Induced Motion Sickness in a VR Environment (2025 IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces Abstracts and Workshops (VRW)) [Conference paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10972842).
