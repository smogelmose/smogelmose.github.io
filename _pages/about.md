Thanks for stopping by!

I have a BSc in Medialogy from Aalborg University Copenhagen and have worked with immersive technologies, human-computer interaction, and user-centered design on both research projects and creative industry projects.

I have a diverse background that includes the development of games and film, biometric sensing, artificial intelligence, interaction design, and experimental research, cybersickness in VR, creative technology, and digital media production.

I assist students and staff in using lab resources and assist with technical equipment management as a part-time student assistant at the Creative Technology Lab.

Currently, I'm involved in the Balance VR research project at the Multisensory Experience Lab, investigating how spatialized sound affects sensory conflict and how balance and motion sickness interact in virtual reality.
