This project's objective was to establish a reliable, scalable framework for studying visually induced motion sickness (VIMS) in virtual-reality. We developed a VR application that combines off-centre rotation, horizontal oscillation, and spatialized audio to amplify sensory conflict and quantifying symptoms via integrated subjective questionnaires and biometric measures. The project was done in collaboration with the Copenhagen Hearing and Balance Centre, Rigshospitalet and ME-Lab - CREATE, AAU.
