## **Balance VR: Sensory Conflict & Motion Sickness in VR**

---
### **Project Overview**
- Study the impact of **spatialized sound** on sensory integration and motion sickness.
- Quantify how **sensory conflicts** affect balance and dizziness.
- Develop **VR protocols** for assessing motion sickness and balance.

---
### **Key Objectives**
- **Quantify Sensory Conflict:** Manipulate visual, vestibular, and auditory inputs in VR to measure their effects on dizziness, motion sickness, and balance.
- **Explore Spatialized Sound:** Assess how **3D audio cues** influence sensory conflict and motion sickness.
