# **Balance VR: Sensory Conflict & Motion Sickness in VR**
*Multisensory Experience Lab*

---
## **Project Overview**
**Balance VR** investigates how **visual, vestibular, and auditory systems** interact in VR, focusing on **sensory conflict, spatialized sound, and motion sickness**. By combining **10MWT, 30CST, and 60BAT** with immersive VR, we aim to:
- Study the impact of **spatialized sound** on sensory integration and motion sickness.
- Quantify how **sensory conflicts** affect balance and dizziness.
- Develop **VR protocols** for assessing motion sickness and balance.

**Fields:** Multisensory Integration, VR, Balance, Auditory Perception

---
## **Key Objectives**
- **Quantify Sensory Conflict:** Manipulate visual, vestibular, and auditory inputs in VR to measure their effects on dizziness, motion sickness, and balance.
- **Explore Spatialized Sound:** Assess how **3D audio cues** influence sensory conflict and motion sickness.
