## **Adaptive Stealth AI in UE5 - Inspired by Alien: Isolation**

---
### **Project Overview**

This project designs and implements an adaptive stealth AI system in Unreal Engine 5 that emulates the tension and unscripted pursuit behavior of the Xenomorph in Alien: Isolation. The system combines AI Perception (sight and hearing), Behavior Trees with Blackboard, and NavMesh-based A* pathfinding to create modular, reactive stealth behavior with patrol, investigation, and chase states.
