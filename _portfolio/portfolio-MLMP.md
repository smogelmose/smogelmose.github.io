## **Facial Expression Classification Using ARKit Blendshape Time-Series Data**

---
### **Project Overview**

This project presents a lightweight facial expression recognition pipeline that classifies seven Ekman-style emotions from ARKit facial motion-capture time series. Using Edge Impulse and a Random Forest model trained on 52 blendshapes plus head/eye pose data, the system achieves 100% validation accuracy and 70% sequence-level accuracy, with potential for real-time MetaHuman emotion recognition in Unreal Engine.
