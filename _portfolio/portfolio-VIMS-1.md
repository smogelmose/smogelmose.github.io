This project's objective was to develop a novel HMD-based VR application to induce VIMS through rotational vection. In addition, the application is designed to implement visual and auditory cybersickness mitigating effects for use in research. The project was done in collaboration with the Copenhagen Hearing and Balance Centre, Rigshospitalet and ME-Lab - CREATE, AAU.
