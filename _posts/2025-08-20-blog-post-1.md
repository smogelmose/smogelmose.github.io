Surprise! Physiological Stress for Allostatic Regulation in Active Inference

https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2406.08471

The study looks at how allostasis - a process that foresees future requirements rather than just responding to existing imbalances - maintains stability in biological and artificial agents. The authors use the active inference framework to model agents as things that try to make the fewest mistakes in predictions so that life-critical physiological states are maintained. Cortisol is introduced as a computational signal in the study, which induces physiological adjustments and alters learning rates during periods of environmental uncertainty. Using different simulations of agents, the text shows that adding these stress-related, predictive mechanisms makes an agent much more viable and flexible over time. In conclusion, the research demonstrates that physiological stress is essential for the coordination of energy-efficient responses to unforeseen external demands.
